Admission Date: 

Diagnosis: Grade 4 astrocytoma with molecular studies indicating an IDH-mutated, ATRX mutated, and MGMT promoter methylated phenotype with hypermutation.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 28-year-old male with a history of a grade 3 astrocytoma, presented to the emergency department with a general tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, he was found to have disease progression with extension into the splenium and anterior-inferior extension into the left thalamus and basal ganglia. Despite changes to his antiepileptic medication, he had seizure recurrence a few weeks following admission.

A repeat maximal safe resection with GammaTile placement was performed due to presuming that the area of tumor recurrence received a definitive dose in the past. The patient developed right upper and lower extremity weakness/spasticity with right foot drop and mild right face weakness as a result of the surgery. 

After the progression of disease in the splenium and left thalamus/basal ganglia was observed, a treatment plan was made to take the progressive regions of disease outside the irradiated GammaTile volume to 35 Gy in 10 fractions. 

Due to the hypermutation phenotype of his tumor, the patient was started on CCNU and completed his EBRT with no issue or progression of his neurological symptoms. He was last seen in follow-up by our team three months after his most recent EBRT, at which point he reported significant improvement in the right leg tremors/spasms and improved headache. He demonstrated decreased right foot drop but continued to have word-finding difficulties and short-term memory deficits.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with severe pain caused by a jellyfish sting injury on the beach. The injury occurred in Hua Hin, Thailand, and the patient received a topical cream at a local hospital before her arrival. At the time of admission, there was reddish stinging marks on her leg accompanied by mild swelling.

Treatment: 

The patient was treated with Silvex® cream and prednisone for local and systemic therapy respectively, while under observation at the hospital. After five days following the initial treatment, the patient developed itching and perifocal redness, and additional antibiotic therapy with intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated. 

Outcome: 

From day 14, the patient's condition deteriorated with deep, tunnel-like necrosis subsequently observed on the left leg. Despite different medical approaches, the necrosis increased. A radical debridement of the area was performed, and vacuum assisted wound therapy initiated. The wounds eventually healed except for a delayed deep necrosis that developed on the right popliteal region. This region was excised, vacuum assisted wound therapy initiated, and the defect was closed with a rotation flap-plasty.

Follow-up Care: 

The patient continued massage therapy and the use of compression stockings as prescribed before being discharged from the hospital. The last examination after skin grafting was performed approximately 8 weeks post the surgery and revealed satisfactory outcomes.

Notably, the patient had a history of hypertension, asthma, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive glomerulosclerosis s/p deceased donor kidney transplant 4 months ago. Upon admission, the patient's vitals were stable except for a fever, and he exhibited bibasilar crackles, more prominent on the left. Laboratory findings revealed an elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. A Chest X-ray showed a left lower lobe consolidation, prompting further investigation. Initial treatment was started with empiric coverage of intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. A CT scan of head and lumbar puncture ruled out any CNS involvement. On day 3, a blood culture grew gram-positive bacilli for which ampicillin was added for better CNS penetration to cover Listeria infection as well. On day 7, further investigation revealed a diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis secondary to pulmonary source (left lower lobe pneumonia). Treatment for nocardiosis was initiated with imipenem/cilastatin, and initial antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ampicillin) were discontinued. The organism was identified as Nocardia transvalensis, which was resistant to imipenem, bactrim, ceftriaxone, augmentin, and minocycline. It was reported to be sensitive to linezolid, amikacin, moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, and tobramycin.

Admission Diagnosis: Diabetic foot ulcer with infection, fracture, and displacement of intermediate cuneiform, and moderate anemia (Grade IV of Wagner classification; Grade III of IWGDF classification) 

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with swelling, pain, and a deteriorating ulcer on the dorsum of the left foot. The patient had a history of diabetes for over twelve years, which was poorly controlled. The patient also experienced a loss of consciousness at home twenty days before admission. Following the fall, the patient regained consciousness after feeding without further medical intervention. However, fifteen days before admission, the patient developed swelling on the left foot dorsum. An ulcer grew on the raised surface of the swelling, which progressively worsened over the next ten days. Self-treatment was ineffective, which led to admission into our department. The physical examination showed swelling with a 2 × 3-cm sized ulcer on the left-foot dorsum. The patient's general tests revealed a body temperature of 38.8°C, blood pressure of 110/60 mmhg, and heart rate of 96 min−1. 

Treatment:

Surgery was performed to accelerate the outflow of pus inside the ulcer to reduce pressure inside the swelling. The surgical incision revealed the displaced intermediate cuneiform, which obstructed the drainage operation. Clearing the obstruction by removing the displaced intermediate cuneiform revealed ~50 ml of yellow pus from the wound. A 4 cm deep vomica close to the arch was uncovered during surgery. The patient received intravenous drip of meropenem (2 g/day twice a day) for 14 days, which helped to inhibit the highly resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The medication was then replaced with oral cefoxitin (0.5 g/day four times a day) for another 14 days. The patient also received effective glycemic control medications, which included subcutaneous injection of insulin aspart (6 IU, three times a day), oral voglibose tablets (0.4 mg, three times a day), and subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine (17 IU once per night). Additionally, Prontosan solution containing 0.1% undecylenamidopropyl betaine and 0.1% polihexanide was used to treat wound infection locally. Irrigation with Prontosan solution, external dressings with Prontosan solution, and Prontosan gel have been applied as local anti-infection treatment for 40 days from the right postoperative day.

Discharge Recommendations:

Chief Complaint: Acute onset of behavioral changes and seizure activity

History of Present Illness: The patient, a 32-year-old female with no known history of seizures, presented with an acute onset of behavioral changes and witnessed seizure activity. Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited uncontrolled laughter, screaming, signs of agitation, spitting on the floor, complete lack of appetite, and foreign accent syndrome. She had two seizures characterized by tongue biting with postictal confusion and agitation. Initial head CT, urine toxicology, and serum electrolytes were normal. The patient was discharged on 500 mg of levetiracetam by mouth twice a day and plans for MRI as an outpatient.

Significant Findings: Brain MRI revealed bilateral (left more than right) temporal lobe fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity. A test of the CSF showed a high number of white blood cells (WBC) and 2 oligoclonal bands, while an EEG revealed status epilepticus characterized by onset of discharges from the left frontocentral and left fronto-temporal region.

Diagnosis: Based on the findings, the patient was diagnosed with NMDAR encephalitis.

Hospital Course: Given the inflammatory CSF, the patient was given 1000 mg of methylprednisolone IV and 0.4 gm/kg of IVIG for 5 days. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) started included levetiracetam, lacosamide, and lamotrigine. She was also maintained on risperidone. However, the patient remained with frequent seizures, behavioral agitation, and psychotic symptoms. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of neoplasm and a transvaginal ultrasound was negative for ovarian teratoma or other tumors. Given her recalcitrant course and presence of antibodies, on day 27 of status, she was started on 375 mg/m2 of rituximab weekly for 4 weeks.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient, a previously healthy 16-month-old male, presented with febrile seizure, rash, and diarrhea. Initial workup in the emergency room, including a CT scan of the head, was not conclusive. After a few hours of observation, the patient was discharged home but returned 12 hours later with an increased fever, worsening rash, and diarrhea. Shortly after admission, he developed distributive shock with worsening hypotension and tachycardia. The patient was intubated and started on vasopressors and inotropes for hypotension. Blood and urine cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The patient met CDC criteria for MIS-C with fever, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased levels of various inflammatory markers. Serial echocardiograms showed hyperdynamic left ventricle systolic function and mild tricuspid regurgitation with no clinical significance and ultimately resolved. EKG showed nonspecific t-wave changes, and troponin was within normal range.

Treatment:

The patient received methylprednisolone, anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and prophylactic Lovenox® dosing. The patient remained intubated for three days and stayed on vasopressors/inotropes. Anakinra dosage was gradually increased over time due to persistent fevers. The patient completed 12 days of anakinra with two doses of IVIG and was maintained on a high dose of methylprednisone, which was tapered down for the rest of stay.

Admitting Diagnosis: Suicidal thoughts and stress
Discharge Diagnosis: N/A

HOSPITAL COURSE

The patient, a male in his 50s, was admitted to the closed psychiatric ward due to suicidal thoughts and stress related to complicated psychosocial circumstances. He had a history of major depressive and personality disorder, with several serious suicide attempts, including overdoses with pharmaceuticals. Upon admission, his suicide risk was assessed to be in phase 4 of a structured suicide risk management taxonomy. However, after a day, it was decreased to phase 3. There were no somatic problems reported.

During his hospital stay, the patient's medication was adjusted, and the tricyclic antidepressant medication (TCA) was increased to near its maximum dosage. The drug was closely monitored to ensure therapeutic blood levels. After the medication was increased, the patient denied having any remaining suicidal thoughts, and his suicide risk was assessed to be in phase 2 of the structured suicide risk management taxonomy. The patient was then discharged to a home that had been arranged for him, with the help of social services.

POST-DISCHARGE

Two days after being discharged, the patient was found dead in his home. The cause of death was registered as a natural death by heart attack, and no autopsy was commissioned. It was later discovered that the patient had taken a high dosage of the TCA medication, which can cause adverse cardiac effects. Since this medication has a narrow therapeutic window and there was no history of cardiac problems, an overdose was deemed to be a likely cause of death. Considering the patient's recent admission into a psychiatric ward due to suicidal thoughts, the previous serious suicide attempts, and the patient's physical health, death by suicide is highly suspected.

Admitting Diagnosis: Coronary heart disease, inferior wall AMI, CAE, arrhythmia, sinus bradycardia, and level I heart function (Killip classification)

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of chest pain lasting for more than an hour. Emergency electrocardiography showed sinus bradycardia and ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. The patient underwent an immediate coronary angiography that showed coronary artery dilatation lesion with diffuse angiectasia. As the guidewire could not pass through owing to the severe coronary artery occlusion, it was impossible to perform coronary stent implantation. The patient was admitted to the intracardiac intensive care unit for further monitoring and treatment.

With conservative drug treatment, regular postoperative cryptogram sulfate, atorvastatin, isopropanol fumarate, and active rescue treatment, the patient's condition was adequately controlled. The patient was given aspirin enteric-coated tablets, clopidogrel sulfate tablets, tirofiban hydrochloride, and low molecular-weight heparin calcium for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, and atorvastatin calcium tablets were used to regulate blood lipids. Perindopril and spironolactone were used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to reverse myocardial remodeling. Calcii Dibutyry-ladenosini Cyclophosphas for injection and Danhong injection were used to improve microcirculation and nourish the myocardium. 

After the blood pressure and heart rhythm were stable, ACEI and beta-blockers administered to resist ventricular remodeling and improve cardiac function and prognosis.

On May 17, 2016, the patient was discharged in stable condition and was advised to continue the medication and follow-up visits as scheduled.

Follow-up:
On January 3, 2019, double-source coronary computed tomography angiography (DSCT-CA) was performed. The results showed that the RCA was the dominant artery and there was no obvious abnormality in the LCA and RCA openings. The proximal part of the LAD ramus and the initial part of the LCx ramus showed local expansion. The wall of the proximal tube of the LAD branch was thickened with the formation of mixed plaques, and the stenosis rate of the adjacent lumen was 30%. The wall of the proximal segment of the left circumflex branch was thickened with mixed plaque formation, which corresponded to about 20% stenosis. Multiple non-calcified plaques and mixed plaques were found throughout the RCA, and the corresponding luminal stenosis was mild. The RCA was locally dilated at the proximal and distal ends and measured about 8-mm wide. The lumen at the second turning point of the RCA showed severe stenosis, and the lumen before and after the second turning point of the RCA expanded. An arc-like, low-density shadow was seen in the inferior wall of the left ventricle, confirming inferior wall AMI.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to the outpatient clinic with gradual visual acuity deterioration in the left eye and no medical history. Best-corrected visual acuity was 9/10 in the right eye and 1/20 in the left eye. A clinical diagnosis of keratoconus was made, and the patient was placed on a waiting list for a penetrating excimer laser-assisted keratoplasty (PKP).

In December 2008, the patient underwent an uneventful PKP, after which an epithelial defect persisted. The patient then underwent an amniotic membrane transplantation and was discharged with bandage contact lens and prednisolone eye drops.

In June 2009, the patient presented to our clinic with a diffuse cloudiness of the corneal graft due to the integrated amniotic membrane. A primary graft failure was diagnosed and intensive treatment with corticosteroids was administered. Since there was no clinical improvement, the patient underwent a repeat keratoplasty in July 2009.

The corneal epithelium healed after the second PKP, and the patient was discharged on topical corticosteroids. The patient was referred to the emergency clinic with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye two weeks later. IOP was normalized, and the patient was discharged with a fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol.

In November 2009, the patient presented to our clinic with a persisting epithelial defect in the left eye, which was then treated with another amniotic membrane transplantation. In October 2010, the patient developed ocular pain in the left eye, and corneal graft failure was diagnosed. An intensive treatment with corticosteroids was administered, but there was no clinical improvement. Therefore, a second repeat PKP was performed in November 2010.

The patient underwent anti-herpetic treatment after the second repeat PKP since immunohistochemical analysis of the corneal graft was positive for HSV-1. The postoperative course was successful, and the patient's corneal graft is currently clear.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a 3-mm linear corneal laceration with iris tissue and lens capsule to the wound, fibrinous reaction, and 0.5-mm hypopyon. A CT scan of the orbit confirmed the presence of a metallic intraocular foreign body (IOFB). The patient underwent primary repair, pars plana lensectomy, vitrectomy, removal of IOFB, and partial air-fluid exchange, leaving him aphakic. During the surgery, dense vitritis and florid vasculitis developed, obscuring the optic disc and vessels. A vitreous specimen was sent for analysis. The patient underwent treatment with intravenous moxifloxacin 400 mg, intravitreal vancomycin 1 mg/0.1 ml and ceftazidime 2.25 mg/0.1 ml, and dexamethasone 0.4 mg/0.1 ml. The patient was then prescribed oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily and topical fortified vancomycin, fortified ceftazidime, and prednisolone 1%.

On post-operative day 1, the patient's visual acuity dropped to light perception, with a 2-mm hypopyon and absent red reflex. A gram stain of the vitreous specimen revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs. A second intravitreal injection of vancomycin 1 mg/0.1 ml was administered. 

On post-operative day 2, no improvement was observed. The primary organism was identified as vancomycin-resistant E. gallinarum, sensitive to ampicillin and gentamicin. Light growth of a gram-negative bacillus was also seen. Intravitreal ampicillin 5 mg/0.1 ml and amikacin 0.4 mg/0.1 ml were administered. A 2-week course of intravenous ampicillin 2 g every 4 h was commenced, plus intravenous clindamycin 600 mg every 8 h and oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily to cover the gram-negative organism (subsequently identified as an Acinetobacter species). Topical therapy was switched to fortified gentamicin and prednisolone 1%. The infection responded quickly to this regime, and the patient's condition improved. 

Recovery was complicated by subsequent inferior retinal detachment, which underwent successful surgical management. At 7 months post-injury, the patient's visual acuity improved to 20/80 (aphakic correction).

Admitting Diagnosis: VF cardiac arrest

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for evaluation of VF cardiac arrest. She was brought to the emergency department after collapsing suddenly during lunch. CPR was initiated, and ROSC was achieved after 10 minutes of CPR and 5 rounds of defibrillation. The patient was intubated for airway protection, and an initial electrocardiogram showed VF. The patient was then transferred to our institution for further evaluation.

Upon our clinical examination, the patient had high blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg and was otherwise haemodynamically stable. Her mental status was stupor, and non-contrast head CT showed no evidence of haemorrhage. Laboratory evaluation showed an increased white blood cell count, prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin-I, and D-dimer. The creatinine kinase-myocardial band and potassium were within normal limits.

An ECG performed in our emergency room showed an RBBB with a deep Q-wave over V1–V4 and resolution of ST elevation. Urgent coronary angiography (CAG) and spasm provocation tests were performed to evaluate for MI or variant angina. No significant stenosis was found in either coronary artery, but significant MB was observed in the distal segment of the left anterior descending artery and diagonal branch. A spasm provocation test on the LCA failed because no spasm or ECG changes were observed. The patient underwent hypothermia treatment for 72 hours and was successfully weaned off the ventilator on day 4 of hospitalization with good neurological recovery.

Further evaluation was performed to identify the cause of VF cardiac arrest. A coronary CT angiogram (CCTA) was performed to exclude pulmonary thromboembolism and to confirm no stenosis on anomalous origin RCA. The patient also underwent heart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which revealed myocardial wall thinning and subendocardial oedema with myocardial scarring.

The patient was discharged on day 25 of hospitalization after full resolution of her presenting symptoms with no neurologic sequelae.

Primary Diagnosis: Obstructive dense mass in the proximal right ureter close to the renal pelvis, secondary to pyelonephritis

Discharge Medications:
- Oral ciprofloxacin

Course of Hospitalization:
The patient was admitted due to acute right-sided flank pain, restlessness, vomiting, and macroscopic hematuria with blood clots. The patient presented with no additional symptoms, and vital functions and physical examination showed no abnormalities except for elevated leukocytes. Blood tests revealed an elevated CRP level and an eGFR (MDRD) of 90 ml/min/1.73 m2. Ultrasound and CT scans revealed an obstructive dense mass in the proximal right ureter close to the renal pelvis, severe parenchymal thickening, multiple small calcifications deep in the calyces, and extensive hydronephrosis of the right kidney. In addition, ground-glass opacities were observed in the peripheral basal lung areas suspect for remnants of a COVID-19 infection.

The patient was started on oral ciprofloxacin, analgesics, ondansetron, and nadroparin prophylaxis. A urine culture was collected, and a nephrostomy catheter was introduced due to an alternating series of macroscopic hematuria with clots. A second abdominal CT revealed signs of extending pyelonephritis, and the procedure failed to drain any purulence.

The patient developed spiking fever, and antibiotic treatment was switched to intravenous cefuroxime with a one-off dose of tobramycin. A thoracic X-ray ruled out a hospital-acquired pneumonia. Moreover, the patient developed slight anemia, marked by the hemoglobin level of 6.4 mmol/L. A third abdominal CT confirmed an ongoing pyelonephritis without any signs of abscesses.

Further diagnostic tests were conducted to rule out pathogens such as E. coli, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but all results were negative. Fundoscopy showed diffuse retinal capillary micro-bleeding in the right eye, so beta-blocker eye droplets were prescribed.

The clinical condition of the patient failed to improve despite adequate treatment and consultations with different departments such as urology, infectious disease, microbiology, neurology, and ophthalmology. The patient's symptoms slowly decreased on the 10th day of admission, and the catheter was removed. The fever disappeared two days later, and the patient was discharged on oral ciprofloxacin treatment for another ten days.

Follow-up through an antegrade pyelography, a micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG), and a CT scan showed a clear decrease in the volume of the right kidney compared to the CT at admission, suggesting scarring of the renal cortex.

The patient reported no recurring complaints and was advised to follow-up for monitoring of blood pressure, eGFR, and urinal protein levels in one year.

Follow-up of the eye through repetitive fundoscopy showed a gradual improvement of the quantity and size of the retinal bleeding sites. However, remnants of bleeding were still visible in the peripheral retina, three months after discharge.","What was the primary diagnosis and medication prescribed for a female patient admitted to the hospital with acute right-sided flank pain, macroscopic hematuria with blood clots, elevated leukocytes, and an obstructive dense mass in the proximal right ureter close to the renal pelvis?","The primary diagnosis of the female patient admitted to the hospital was an obstructive dense mass in the proximal right ureter close to the renal pelvis, secondary to pyelonephritis.

Hospital Course:
A 59-year-old male with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus resulting in diabetic nephropathy was referred to our oncology clinic due to a large ulcer on his right temporoparietal region. The patient had received superficial X-ray radiotherapy during his childhood due to Tinea Capitis infection. Biopsy results indicated the presence of Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) in the skin lesion, and the patient underwent two surgeries and 25 sessions of radiotherapy in the past. However, despite these treatments, the lesion recurred after primary remission, and chemotherapy was recommended as the next course of action. Due to his history of renal insufficiency, Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens were deemed unsuitable for the patient. Therefore, the patient was initiated on Cetuximab (600 mg loading dose and 375 mg weekly doses), which resulted in grade 2 skin reactions. Skin reactions due to Cetuximab were acneiform lesions treated with Topical Pliazon. The patient demonstrated an acceptable response to the treatment, and the lesion became almost dry with a significant reduction in the ulcer's size and cessation of bleeding.

The cause of the patient's symptoms was unknown, and he was subsequently referred to our department. The patient's symptoms did not resemble intermittent claudication. He did not have any pain, and his symptoms did not interfere with his work as an English teacher.

Past Medical History:
The patient had gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he was taking oral esomeprazole. The patient's family history was unremarkable. The patient had a smoking history of 10 cigarettes per day for over 50 years and social/opportunity drinking.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a 10 minute test walk during which no clear involuntary movements were observed. However, based on the patient's report, paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia was considered one of the paroxysmal dyskinesias as the attacks were precipitated by physical exertion. Four weeks after presentation, carbamazepine 200mg/day was administered for therapeutic diagnostic purposes, and the severity and frequency of the symptoms were reduced by half. Eight weeks after presentation, the patient's dose of carbamazepine was increased to 300mg/day, and the symptoms resolved the following day. To differentiate psychogenic diseases such as depression and panic disorder, the oral medication was switched from carbamazepine to duloxetine; however, the symptoms returned 2 days later. The patient's oral medication was then reverted back to carbamazepine, and his condition improved the following day. Therefore, it was determined that carbamazepine had a specific effect on the primary disease.

Findings:
The patient's neurological examination showed normal results, and no abnormalities were found in his laboratory tests.

Impression:
The patient's symptoms were consistent with paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. The symptoms were relieved by the administration of carbamazepine.

Follow-Up:
The patient was discharged with instructions to continue taking carbamazepine 300mg/day. The patient was advised to avoid physical exertion that could trigger the symptoms. A follow-up appointment was scheduled to monitor the patient's condition.

Discharge Medications:
Carbamazepine 300mg/day.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient, a 35-year-old male French soldier was deployed to Djibouti when he presented with symptoms of fever, headaches, and diarrhea for four days. He had no medical history, except for intermittent use of doxycycline (100 mg/day) malaria prophylaxis, and no recent trips, except a return to France during summer holidays. A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria was positive for P. falciparum. He was referred to a military hospital, and laboratory tests showed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, moderate elevation in hepatic enzymes, and bilirubin. Parasite detection in blood using quantitative buffy coat (QBC) was positive, and examination of thin blood smear stained by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa method confirmed the diagnosis of P. falciparum infection. He did not meet the criteria for severe P. falciparum malaria. He was admitted to the hospital and treated with DP (40 mg dihydroartemisinin plus 320 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate) for three days, recommended by Sigma-Tau laboratory since there were no data on dosage recommendations for patients weighing above 100 kg. The patient was discharged with no fever and negative QBC test on the third day of hospitalization. He was asymptomatic at day 12 with negative QBC test. However, at day 20, he complained of recurrence of P. falciparum with fever and diarrhea. A thin blood smear found late-stage trophozoites without gametocytes.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a previously healthy 21-year-old man, was admitted with a six-month history of night sweats, fever, axillary lymphadenopathy, and neurological symptoms including vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, left-sided weakness, and right facial droop. An axillary mass biopsy revealed granulomatous lymphadenitis, and further investigations revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the pontomedullary junction, right cerebellum, and left frontal lobe. 
Treatment was initiated with HREZ and dexamethasone, which led to partial neurological improvement. However, the patient later developed nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and headache, with a further reduction in power and coordination on the left side. Repeat MRI showed increased oedema and size of the pontomedullary and right cerebellar lesions with hydrocephalus. The dexamethasone dose was increased, and HREZ continued, leading to symptom improvement. Later, after the susceptibility results came in, the therapy was changed to rifabutin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, amikacin, moxifloxacin, cycloserine, and prothionamide. The patient was weaned off dexamethasone and was discharged on a weaning dose of cortisone. Amikacin was ceased after twelve months while other treatment was continued for a total of two years after repeat MRI showed almost complete resolution of the lesions. 
During the treatment, the patient developed avascular necrosis of the hip, hip pain, and minor difficulty with left upper limb fine motor tasks. Repeat MRI scans were conducted, showing complete resolution of the right cerebellar lesion and continued improvement in the pontomedullary lesion. 
After seven years of follow-up, the patient's residual symptoms include minor difficulty with left upper limb fine motor tasks and hip pain.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 27-year-old Malay lady, was admitted to the Oral Medicine Clinic of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) in October 2014 for sharp electric-shock-like pain over the left upper gingivae. The clinical and radiographic examinations showed no possible source of odontogenic pathology or infection that could contribute to the pain, and based on the clinical findings, she was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia. She was prescribed CBZ, which was increased to 300 mg per day due to poorly controlled neuropathic pain. However, five days following the new CBZ regimen, she developed blistering rashes in her vagina and feet along with urticaria involving both her upper and lower limbs and face, oral ulcerations, and conjunctivitis of both eyes. She was diagnosed with SJS secondary to CBZ and treated accordingly.

Clinical Findings:
The patient presented with urticaria involving both her upper and lower limbs and face, oral ulcerations, and conjunctivitis of both eyes. Her skin lesion was controlled with Betamethasone 17 valerate 1:4 cream and an aqueous cream, and her eyes were treated with sodium hyaluronate 0.18% eye drop and Maxitrol eye ointment. Additionally, the patient was prescribed a combination of analgesia and antiseptic mouthwash (magnesium trisilicate, diphenhydramine, and lignocaine) and 5 mL nystatin 100,000 IU/mL was prescribed for five times daily to ease and treat the painful oral ulcers. Potassium permanganate 1:20,000 (5%) 5 mL solution was used during bath once daily.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
The patient was diagnosed with SJS secondary to CBZ. CBZ was discontinued completely, and she was advised against its prescription ever. During hospitalization, the patient and her family were counseled about the genetic predilection for SJS following CBZ intake, that is, HLA-B∗15:02. The patient was prescribed the allergic card by the hospital pharmacy for this purpose. A week after her discharge, the patient was prescribed with gabapentin 300 mg, once daily by the neurologist.

Follow-Up Care:
Surgical decompression was discussed with the patient, but she and her family disagreed with this option. The patient was very traumatized with this episode of hospitalization that she refused to take the gabapentin. The patient discharged herself from the care before the medical team could proceed with the genetic testing to confirm the presence of HLA-B∗15:02.

Final Diagnosis: SJS secondary to CBZ.

Overall Impressions:This Malay lady presented with sharp electric-shock-like pain over the left upper gingivae, and there was no possible source of odontogenic pathology or infection that could contribute to the pain. She was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and was prescribed CBZ, which later led to the development of SJS.

Hospital Course:
The patient was a 75-year-old Japanese man who was hospitalized with a complaint of lower extremity weakness for a duration of 3 days. He had a past history of laminectomy for spinal canal stenosis and transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and was taking an anticholinergic drug, propiverine, and a β3 adrenergic receptor agonist, mirabegron, for the treatment of urinary urgency. Upon physical examination, it was observed that the patient had bilateral leg edema. Laboratory examination showed that the patient’s d-dimer level was elevated. However, chest radiography showed no sign of pleural effusion.

The patient was diagnosed with DVT and PE due to urinary retention, which was attributed to detrusor insufficiency owing to both taking an anticholinergic drug and neurogenic bladder. The patient was started on anticoagulant therapy using rivaroxaban and propiverine and mirabegron were discontinued. He was also hospitalized and a urethral catheter was inserted for urinary retention. On the second day of hospitalization, his lower extremity edema and lower limb muscle strength had improved bilaterally.

Hospital Course: The patient is a 52-year-old male with a 20-year history of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) who presented with severe motor fluctuations including end-of-dose wearing off, freezing of gait, and peak-dose dyskinesia. The patient had a history of impulse-control disorders associated with dopamine agonists and a history of depression. After comprehensive multidisciplinary deep brain stimulation (DBS) assessment, he underwent staged bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS based on the ability to reduce dopaminergic medications with the target compared with the globus pallidus interna (GPi). He underwent sequential bilateral STN-DBS, with a microelectrode recording done during both procedures and typical STN-neuronal discharges recorded. Macro-stimulation during final placement yielded non-specific side effects including dizziness at high levels followed by corticobulbar side effects with dysarthria.

Summary of Findings: During initial DBS monopolar review 1 month after surgery, he noticed a sudden onset of “giddiness and euphoria” best described as a need to laugh that was overwhelming and precluded him from talking when activating right STN contact 0. Partial benefit in Parkinsonism was observed with ventral contacts and the patient developed right foot dyskinesia, mild reduction in bradykinesia, and reduction in rigidity around 3.5 V. The uncontrollable laughter was reproducible after 6 months. Corticospinal side effects and non-specific dizziness were the most common side effects associated with stimulation of contacts 2 and 3. The final programming settings were bipolar with contact 3 positive, contact 2 negative, PW 90 µs, and frequency 140 Hz. His UPDRS-III score off medications at 1 year improved from 42 to 15 points.

Principal Diagnosis: Plasmodium malariae infection with renal complications 

Hospital Course:
The patient initially presented with fever, headaches, myalgia, vomiting, and was hospitalized for treatment of malaria at Abdoul Aziz Sy healthcare Centre. Upon failing to recover, he was referred to the Infectious Disease Clinic at Fann Hospital for further evaluation. While there, he was treated with medications including furosemide, metronidazole, metopimazine, dycinone, and omeprazole. He also experienced anuria for three days. Results of microscopic evaluation for malaria were negative at this time. As his condition worsened, he was transferred to the Nephrology Clinic at Aristide LeDantec Hospital, where he received dialysis and was diagnosed with cortical necrosis post malaria with associated secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions. 

The patient's renal function was monitored throughout the hospitalization with repeated measurements of creatinine, urea and potassium. Following treatment with ceftriaxone 1 g/day, he was hospitalized again three months later at Philippe Senghor healthcare centre due to diarrhoea, fever, chills, asthenia and anorexia for a week. Due to his renal condition, he was once again referred to Aristide LeDantec Hospital where he underwent emergency dialysis treatment as his potassium levels were significantly elevated. He was diagnosed with Plasmodium malariae infection and later treated with quinine and paracetamol for pain. 

After a month of treatment, the patient's creatinine, creatinine clearance, sodium, potassium, and chloride levels were measured, and he was found to have a partial recovery in renal function. A renal biopsy was performed and revealed nephrotic reduction with significant parenchymal damage likely due to severe nephroangiosclerosis and pyelonephritis. 

At the end of his hospitalization, the patient remained under the care of the nephrology clinic and was monitored for further recovery of his renal function. Discharge was recommended following their evaluation. 

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with Plasmodium malariae infection with renal complications. Cortical necrosis post malaria was established. Associated pathology included secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions and interstitial fibrosis. 

Follow-up:
The patient should be followed up by the nephrology clinic to monitor his renal function recovery. Any changes in his health status, including symptoms of infection or fever, should be reported immediately.

Admitting Diagnosis: Altered mental status

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital from a care home for altered mental status. According to the case manager, the patient had visited her psychiatrist four days prior and her medications were adjusted. Her past medical history included schizoaffective disorder, essential tremor, migraines, seizure disorder, cerebrovascular accident, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was started on clonazepam 1 mg daily, divalproex sodium 500 mg twice daily was restarted and quetiapine was increased from 100 mg to 150 mg in the evening. Following these adjustments, the patient developed increased somnolence.

The patient underwent several laboratory and diagnostic tests after admission. On admission, vital signs were stable and initial computerized tomography of the brain was normal. Initial laboratory tests were ordered, including blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, which were all negative. Urine drug screen and alcohol detection tests were negative except for barbiturates (patient on primidone). Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Ammonia level was elevated at 132 mcmol/L, and valproic acid level on admission was 120 mcg/mL (reference range: 50–150 mcg/mL). An EEG showed moderate to severe slowing and no seizure activity, which were deemed to be consistent with metabolic encephalopathy.

All psychotropic medications were held on admission, and the patient was started on lactulose 10 gm per nasogastric tube every four hours as needed to titrate to 3 bowel movements/day for encephalopathy, heparin 5000 units subcutaneous every 8 hours for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and continuous intravenous fluids. After 2 days of hospitalization, the patient became more responsive but was not back to baseline.

On day 3 of hospitalization, the patient developed a fever, and a chest X-ray revealed a focal infiltrate in left lung. At that time, she was started on moxifloxacin for presumed community acquired pneumonia versus aspiration. With only mild improvement in patient responsiveness, decision was made to do a lumbar puncture which was negative.

On day 6, a neurologist was consulted. She noted that patient's mental status had improved, but that she was agitated and psychosis appeared worse. Primidone, paroxetine, and quetiapine were restarted along with continued treatment of pneumonia with moxifloxacin to finish out the course of 14 days. Upon day 10 of hospitalization, the patient was noted to be back at baseline and ready for discharge once cleared by mobile crisis team. The patient was discharged in stable condition to a psychiatric unit. It was determined by internal medicine team as well as neurologist that acute encephalopathy was likely due to hyperammonemia induced by reinitiation of valproic acid and sedating effects of medications.

Follow-up:
The patient will be followed-up by her primary care physician and psychiatrist at the care home. Close monitoring of her symptoms and medications will be necessary to prevent any further episodes of encephalopathy or other complications.

Summary:
A 52-year-old female was admitted to the hospital from a care home for altered mental status. Initial laboratory studies revealed elevated ammonia levels and valproic acid levels on admission. All psychotropic medications were held on admission, and the patient was treated with lactulose and intravenous fluids. An EEG showed metabolic encephalopathy.

Laboratory results showed leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ESR, and abnormal liver function tests. She was empirically treated with intravenous doxycycline and ceftriaxone for presumptive diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and possible bacterial sepsis respectively. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed increased protein and white blood cells. Blood culture, urine culture, and serology for several infections were dispatched. However, all cultures remained negative, while IgM antibody for Rocky Mountain spotted fever was equivocal and IgG antibody was negative. Ceftriaxone was discontinued after the patient became less febrile and the rash improved, but with residual macular rash. ECG and echocardiogram were normal one week after illness onset, but she had a small posterior/inferior pericardial effusion on echocardiogram. Serology for other infections was also negative but given her irritability, erythematous lips, swelling of her hands and feet, and residual macular rash, intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin were started for presumptive diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. She became afebrile within 12 hours and her swelling and macular rash resolved within 72 hours following IGIV therapy. Her pancytopenia resolved 48 hours after IGIV therapy and she was discharged after a week of hospitalization. Her clinical course, hematologic parameters, ECG, and echocardiogram were normal on follow-up.

Hospital: Tor Vergata University Hospital

Admitting Diagnosis: Blood-borne Staphylococcus Aureus Infection

Principal Diagnosis: Mitral Valve Infective Endocarditis

Major Procedures: Cardiopulmonary Bypass, Mitral Valve Repair 

Hospital Course:

The patient, an 18-year-old Caucasian, Italian female, was admitted to the emergency room with fever, nausea, malaise, and difficult walking, which was suggestive of a sepsis infection. Physical examination revealed hypotension, dehydration, and multiple Janeway, Furunculosis, and Osler lesions on the skin. The diagnosis of blood-borne Staphylococcus Aureus infection was confirmed by blood culture obtained on admission. The patient underwent whole-body computed tomography (CT), which revealed multiple septic emboli in the cerebellar and occipital cerebral regions, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, including gentamycin, oxacillin, vancomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftriaxone, and rifampicin. Surgical intervention was performed due to the vegetation that was dangerously fluctuating in the left atrial cavity, and the mitral valve incompetence was corrected by means of median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and antegrade tepid blood cardioplegia. During the immediate postoperative period, echocardiographic controls revealed a well functioning mitral valve. However, two weeks following surgery, the patient developed heart failure, which required a new surgical procedure that entailed mitral valve repair and stabilization with a prosthetic ring sutured to the posterior segment of the mitral annulus. After 40 days of treatment with antibiotics, the patient was discharged and prescribed a long-term antibiotic treatment to completely eradicate the cerebellar abscesses. Serial echocardiographic examinations were performed, and the patient appeared to have fully recovered, with only trivial regurgitation of the mitral valve.

Admitting Diagnosis: Tubercular meningitis

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine with complaints of fever, decreased appetite, and headache. Purpuric rashes were observed all over the body for the last four days. The patient had a history of taking streptomycin, rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide daily over the previous 14 days. A provisional diagnosis of rifampicin-induced thrombocytopenia was made. The patient's platelet count was 40,000/mm3, and the bleeding time was 7 minutes while the clotting time was 13 minutes. The patient was managed conservatively and discharged after the platelet count reached 4.5 lac/mm3, and the purpuric rashes subsided.

Course of Treatment:

The patient was given antituberculosis therapy with streptomycin, isoniazid, and ethambutol, avoiding rifampicin initially since the drug was suspected to be the causal agent for thrombocytopenia. After the patient's platelet count had stabilized, rifampicin was introduced along with streptomycin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. Pyrazinamide was stopped as it was thought to be the probable cause of the patient's thrombocytopenia.

Clinical outcome:

The patient was asymptomatic and had a normal bleeding profile after two months of treatment. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue the prescribed medication, monitor symptoms closely, and schedule a follow-up with their physician in six months.

Summary:

The 20-year-old male student was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever, decreased appetite, and headache.

Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, and anorexia.

Hospital Course: This 56-year-old male was admitted with nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, and anorexia, along with 6–8 nonbloody, small volume, liquid bowel movements daily, within a week of loop ileostomy closure surgery. He was examined and found to have nonspecific abdominal tenderness, with normal bowel sounds. Hemoglobin, platelet count, and white blood cell count were all within normal limits. Subsequent abdominal computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated extensive pneumatosis coli involving the descending colon. Initial stool collections were negative for the C. difficile cytotoxin assay, bacterial culture, and ova/parasites. The patient was placed on intravenous metronidazole 500 mg q8h for three days due to clinical suspicion for a Clostridium difficile-associated diarrheal (CDAD) infection. Metabolic alkalosis was present on blood gas but there was no acidosis that might have suggested a gut ischemia. Flexible sigmoidoscopy clinically confirmed the diagnosis showing quite classical pseudomembranes in addition to features consistent with pneumatosis intestinalis. Biopsies revealed a focal active colitis with superficial ulceration, gland destruction, and areas in which exudates overlay the colonic mucosa, all supporting the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis. Two subsequent C. difficile toxin assays proved negative. The intravenous metronidazole was then changed to oral vancomycin, and the patient improved over the subsequent week with a reduction in the frequency of bowel motions and a marked improvement in abdominal discomfort. Follow-up abdominal CT scan 8 days after the initial study revealed resolution of the pneumatosis coli. At the time of discharge, the patient was well without a recurrence of either entity.

Diagnosis: Pseudomembranous colitis with pneumatosis coli.

Treatment: Intravenous metronidazole was initially administered for three days subsequently changed to oral vancomycin at 125 mg four times daily for four days.

Condition at Discharge: The patient's condition at the time of discharge was stable. 

Follow-up Care: The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further management and monitoring of his condition.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 70-year-old Chinese woman, was admitted to our hospital with a history of psoriasis vulgaris and uveitis. Despite good clinical efficacy for the irregularly administered oral acitretin and Chinese medicine, her skin lesions progressively worsened with the joint pain and swelling in both fifth fingers. The patient was diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors, including etanercept and infliximab. Although this significantly improved her lesions, her vision in both eyes became impaired, and she was eventually diagnosed with noninfectious uveitis. The patient received methylprednisolone treatment and other medications for five years, during which her vision deteriorated further. In 2019, the patient was treated with secukinumab by subcutaneous injection, which proved to be effective in clearing her psoriatic lesions and improved her visual acuity in her left eye.

Medical History: History of hypertension, traumatic brain injury (TBI), synthetic marijuana abuse, and generalized seizure disorder (diagnosed after TBI in 2014 and has not been compliant with taking her AEDs).

Admission Diagnosis: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Repeat doses of intravenous (IV) lorazepam were required to physically suppress the convulsions. IV magnesium was given as it was unknown at this point whether eclampsia was playing a role in her condition. Initial electroencephalography (EEG) showed periodic lateralized discharges in the right hemisphere. Head imaging were negative for acute findings and laboratory results were unremarkable.

The patient was started on IV levetiracetam and midazolam, but her seizure activity persisted. Propofol 55 mcg/kg/min, fosphenytoin 100 mg IV three times per day, lacosamide 400 mg IV twice per day, ketamine 2 mg/kg/h, and pentobarbital 2 mg/kg/h were added to the regimen, given the persistent abnormal EEG findings. An EEG burst suppression pattern (seizure control) was finally achieved for the first time after 25 hours of pharmacologic therapy at maximal doses.

Weaning of pentobarbital was attempted after several days of non-epileptic EEG pattern, but bilateral cerebral hemisphere seizure activity quickly recurred, forcing continued use of pentobarbital at maximum doses. Furthermore, fetal distress was noted on hospital day 6 requiring an emergent bedside cesarean section.

After delivery, valproic acid and pyridoxine were added, and burst suppression pattern was again achieved on hospital day 10. The patient’s neurological status slowly improved, allowing for liberation from mechanical ventilation. Finally, after 14 days of hospitalization, a normal EEG pattern was obtained, and the patient was transferred out of the intensive care unit. The patient’s baby had a prolonged hospitalization, but was eventually discharged home.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of heel pain. The physical examination revealed bilateral positive sacroiliac compression test and painful Achilles tendon, particularly on the left side with palpation. Ultrasonographic evaluation revealed tendinitis of the Achilles tendons, and cortical irregularity of calcaneus bone in the left heel. The Schirmer’s test result was positive, indicating dry eyes. The patient had a history of optic neuritis episodes three times within 19 years.

After the last episode of optic neuritis on January 2018, rheumatologic investigation was performed. The ANA test result was positive. The salivary gland biopsy revealed signs of Grade 1 inflammation according to the Chisholm-Mason classification which did not meet the diagnostic criteria of primary Sjögren’s syndrome fully. The patient was started on treatment with azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and methylprednisolone. However, she had no benefit from these medications, with a poor effect on heel pain.

The MRI of the sacroiliac joint was performed, and active sacroiliitis was detected. The patient was diagnosed with peripheral sensory polyneuropathy due to the numbness in her lower extremities. The HLA-B27 test yielded a negative result.

The patient was prescribed diclofenac 75 mg twice a day, but the symptoms did not relieve. At three weeks of follow-up, the medication was switched to methotrexate 15 mg/week, and the complaints regressed. At one month of follow-up, the morning stiffness decreased to 15 min with improved VAS scores for low back, right and left heel pain.

Name: [Redacted], Sex: Female, Age: 57
Diagnosis: Major depression, Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS)

Course of Hospitalization:
The patient was initially referred to a local dental clinic where she was diagnosed with BMS, taking into account her depressive state. Subsequently, the patient was referred to our psychiatry department outpatient unit. She reported increased stress levels due to a new department, increased workload and complicated relationships with other workers in her workplace, causing her to experience symptoms such as depressive mood, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, general fatigue, glossodynia, and tinnitus. Her vital signs were normal, and routine blood tests and imaging tests showed no significant abnormality. She was started on 20mg/day duloxetine for symptom relief, which was gradually increased to 40mg/day. After treatment with duloxetine, her depressive mood and other symptoms improved moderately. However, symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and loss of concentration persisted. Her glossodynia continued after the initiation of the treatment, leading to the addition of clonazepam (1mg/day) with ongoing duloxetine (40mg/day) therapy. However, the glossodynia persisted, and she experienced nausea upon increasing the duloxetine dosage to 60mg/day, leading to a switch to vortioxetine (10mg/day) in combination with duloxetine and clonazepam therapy. After four weeks of vortioxetine treatment, her depressive symptoms further improved, with her HAMD score going down to 12 points.

Medical Condition at Discharge:
The patient's depressive symptoms, including anxiety, loss of concentration, and insomnia, further improved eight weeks post-initiation of the vortioxetine treatment. Her glossodynia and tinnitus had partially improved, and she did not experience tongue and oral mucosa pain but felt mild oral mucosa discomfort. Her tinnitus frequency reduced ten weeks after beginning treatment with vortioxetine, and her HAMD score was 7 points. She continued the treatment with vortioxetine (20mg/day) and experienced relief of her depressive symptoms, and her tinnitus completely disappeared. She sometimes complained of mild oral mucosa discomfort after experiencing workplace stress.

Follow-up Recommendations:
We recommend regular follow-up with the psychiatry department and to continue the vortioxetine treatment (20mg/day) as prescribed for long-term symptom relief. Additionally, we suggest the incorporation of stress-reducing techniques into her daily routine and suggested possible medication and dosage adjustments if the patient experiences significant symptoms.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with a haemodynamically stable broad complex tachycardia (BCT) of 180 b.p.m. The twelve-lead ECG suggested VT, supported by its refractoriness to intravenous adenosine administered via a large cannula at the antecubital fossa. The patient was initially managed with intravenous amiodarone but subsequent haemodynamic compromise necessitated an external direct current cardioversion.

Two hours later, the patient had recurrent stable VT with a different morphology while on telemetry and reported symptoms similar to those of the haemodynamically compromised VT. A trial of valsalva manoeuvre led to immediate VT termination. In the first 12 h, the patient had recurrent episodes of VT, all of which terminated by valsalva manoeuvre. Twelve hours after initiation of intravenous amiodarone, he had no further VT. He was transitioned to oral amiodarone and bisoprolol.

The patient, a 75-year-old Japanese woman, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-month history of loose stools and a 2-week history of bloody stools, abdominal pain, and fever. She was diagnosed with infectious enteritis at a local hospital and started on oral antibiotics, yet the symptoms persisted. Upon hospital admission, she continued to experience fever, diarrhea, and bloody stools.

Sigmoidoscopy revealed multiple deep ulcers in the bowel segment extending from the rectum to the sigmoid colon. The laboratory tests indicated leukocytosis, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated inflammatory markers. Stool test results were negative for Clostridium difficile.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed hypertrophy of the bowel wall extending from the rectum to the transverse colon, and the patient was diagnosed with severe ulcerative colitis (UC) of the pancolitis type. To prevent the disease from becoming fulminant, the patient was initiated on intravenous prednisolone, tacrolimus, and 5-aminosalicylic acid.

Although the patient tested negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia, ganciclovir was administered concurrently due to suspected CMV infection based on endoscopic findings. Within 2 weeks of this treatment, our patient's clinical activity index showed significant improvement, and sigmoidoscopy indicated re-epithelialization of the ulcers.

Nevertheless, she developed fever again, and CT revealed toxic megacolon. Total colectomy was performed, along with the creation of a rectal mucous fistula and end ileostomy. During the postoperative course, the patient had recurring hemorrhage and infections and also developed Pneumocystis pneumonia 1 month after surgery. She unfortunately died of hemorrhagic shock 4 months after surgery.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 51-year-old Caucasian female with chronic kidney disease stage 5, secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, who received a preemptive deceased donor kidney transplant at our institution. Posttransplant, the patient developed a moderate-sized pericardial effusion, which was diagnosed on a computed tomogram of the thoracic spine without contrast during a routine follow-up visit 1 year after her transplant. Subsequently, an ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed, revealing a transudative effusion with no evidence of infection or hemorrhage. A viral pericarditis causing pericardial effusion was suspected, and a trial of prednisone and colchicine was initiated. However, within 1 week, the patient developed severe abdominal cramping with nausea and had to be admitted, leading to the discontinuation of colchicine. The patient's symptoms persisted and her tamponade physiology worsened, requiring a switch from tacrolimus to cyclosporine. Within 2 months of stopping tacrolimus, her symptoms resolved, and a follow-up echocardiogram revealed a marked decrease in the size of the pericardial effusion.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a 7-year history of pain and discomfort over the back with soreness and swelling of the muscles, sometimes accompanied by ""itchiness in the bones"". The symptoms worsened when holding a fixed posture or trying to sleep at night, and the patient always felt an urge to move like twisting, bending, stretching the back, or punching it with her own fists, which temporarily relieved the discomfort. She reported a visual analog scale (VAS) score of 6/10 for pain at the first visit.

Initial workup, including an MRI scan of the spine and brain, laboratory tests, and rheumatoid markers, did not yield any remarkable findings, and she was diagnosed as having general anxiety, for which amitriptyline was prescribed. After 3 months of amitriptyline, Paroxetine was added for another half year, still resulting in no relief.

The diagnosis of “Restless Back” was suspected, and the patient fulfilled the 4 criteria of restless legs syndrome (RLS) - an urge to move accompanied by unpleasant sensations, that worsened during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying down or sitting, were relieved partially or totally by movement, and became worse in the evening or night than during the day, but her symptoms happened in the back rather than legs. The rheumatoid tests and MRI scan excluded the condition of rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.

The patient responded positively to dopaminergic treatment. Levodopa with benserazide at a ratio of 4:1 was added (125 mg of Madopar®, twice a day), which significantly relieved her back pain and discomfort, together with discomfort over hips and shoulders, with a VAS score of 2/10 in a 2-week follow-up visit. The patient was gradually tailed down paroxetine, which was finally off in 3 months.

Admitting Diagnosis: Known carotid artery stenosis

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for management of known carotid artery stenosis. Medical history was significant for nasopharyngeal lymphoma status post chemo and radiation therapy 14 years ago, and two episodes of left middle cerebral artery territory infarction, one and seven years ago. Upon admission, the patient exhibited no neurological deficits.

The patient was kept on aspirin (100 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d) for two weeks prior to the procedure, as usual preventive medication. A digital subtraction angiography revealed severe (85%) long segmental stenosis of the left common carotid and mild stenosis of the right vertebral artery orifice. A Savvy balloon pre-dilatation of the stenotic left common carotid was performed before deploying the SMART self-expandable carotid stent (7 × 80mm, Cordis, Miami, USA). Due to residual stenosis, Savvy balloon post-dilatation was performed, which lasted for approximately 20 seconds. Immediately post-dilatation, a small filling defect was noted at the distal stent aspect, which was suspected to be acute platelet rich thrombus. The antiplatelet agent tirofiban was infused intravenously to dissolve the in-stent thrombus. The patient received a continuous infusion for the next 26 hours. Brain MRI after tirofiban showed a small asymptomatic acute infarction on the right occipital lobe in diffusion-weighted images.

No occlusion of the distal intracranial vessels occurred, and there were no hemorrhagic complications. The patient was discharged without complication on the fourth post-procedure day.

Admitting Diagnosis: Non-healing surgical wound from right transmetatarsal amputation

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a non-healing surgical wound from his right transmetatarsal amputation. A magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated significant iliofemoral disease and occluded right SFA. Bilateral kissing stents of the common iliac arteries were performed. Closure of the 7F right SFA puncture site was attempted using an Angio-Seal, but it was unsuccessful which resulted in continuous bleeding. The heavily calcified right profunda was punctured under fluoroscopic guidance, and a 5F sheath was inserted. Angiogram confirmed that the footplate had become lodged in the proximal CFA. The occlusion was crossed with catheter and wire, and a 5 mm × 19 mm (Express Vascular SD; Boston Scientific) balloon-mounted stent was deployed that re-established blood flow to the profunda since the SFA was chronically occluded. Haemostasis was then achieved with prolonged manual haemostasis.

Hospital course: A 35-year-old female presented with symptoms of schizophrenia including third person and commanding type auditory hallucination, delusion of persecution and reference with frequent acting on behavior as well as sudden unprovoked violence, decreased sleep and appetite with marked socio-occupational dysfunction since last two months. After careful evaluation, she was prescribed tablet iloperidone 1 mg twice daily and tablet clonazepam 2 mg at night. Her dose of iloperidone was increased up to 4 mg twice daily within one week. 

Over the next two weeks, the patient's symptoms began to improve and completely resolved within two months with the same dose of iloperidone (8 mg/day). The dose of tablet clonazepam was reduced to 0.5 mg at night. Three months after starting Iloperidone, patient developed spontaneous milky discharge from both the nipples and on the next menstrual cycle, she missed her date. Through detailed work-up, it was determined that iloperidone-induced galactorrhea could be the possible reason. Hence, tablet iloperidone was stopped, and tablet aripiprazole (2.5 mg twice daily) was started. Dramatic resolution of galactorrhea was noted within 1 week of stopping the iloperidone. Her psychotic symptoms remained controlled (PANSS score was 47). Her next menstrual flow was scanty but resumed her normal menstrual bleeding on the second month of stoppage of iloperidone when serum prolactin level was rechecked and found to be reverted back to the normal range (15.90 ng/ml).

Secondary Diagnosis: Fungus infection, pulmonary inflammation

Hospital Course
The patient was admitted 70 days postoperative with symptoms of dizziness, headaches, and blurred vision which were followed by seizures and epileptiform activity. She had recently received an allogeneic HSCT for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and was receiving antirejection therapy with CsA, mycophenolate, and methylprednisolone. The chest CT showed the presence of fungal infection in the superior lobe of the right lung which was not responding to initial antibiotic therapy. Further tests showed an increase in the blood concentration of CsA, indicating a possible interaction between CsA and voriconazole.

Management and Treatment
The patient was initially treated with carbamazepine, rotundine, and citicoline sodium for symptomatic relief, followed by diazepam and phenobarbital to control the seizures. Voriconazole was suspended, and other medications such as alprostadil, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin were administered to improve microcirculation and reduce hyperlipemia. Cefoperazone and sulbactam were used to control the inflammation in the right lung. The dosage of CsA was adjusted to avoid drug toxicity.

Outcome
The patient's condition improved gradually, and she was discharged 12 days later with satisfactory blood concentration of CsA and improved imaging results. Voriconazole was re-administered to control fungal infection in bilateral lungs and her condition remained stable during the hospital stay. Follow-up tests showed elevated levels of 1-3-β-D polyglucosan, probable due to the recent surgery, but no other significant findings. The patient was advised to continue regular check-ups and medication as prescribed by the hematologist.

Hospital Course:

A 32-year-old male patient with a past medical history of trichotillomania was admitted for opioid dependency. The patient has a history of multiple unsuccessful attempts to quit opioids and underwent rapid detoxification under anesthesia a year ago, which later resulted in relapse. The patient was initially treated with clonidine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and benzodiazepine. These medications were successful in resolving rhinorrhea, lacrimation, loose motion, body ache, and anxiety; however, the patient continued to experience sleep induction and maintenance issues. Pharmacological management of benzodiazepine was escalated, but sleep disturbances continued for two weeks.

Further inquiry revealed that the patient experienced creeping, crawling, and burning sensations in both lower limbs while lying down, primarily at night. A neurology consultation was obtained, and the patient was diagnosed with restless leg syndrome. An electroencephalogram, along with serum urea, creatinine, ferritin, and thyroid function tests, was performed, which yielded no significant abnormality. The patient was started on ropinirole and began to experience clinical improvement within two days. The patient was successfully tapered off benzodiazepine and remained on ropinirole for a month, following which the medication was gradually tapered off without any adverse effects.
